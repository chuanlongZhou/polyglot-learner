- npm or yarn

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd polyglot-drill
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```


3. Start the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

4. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5173`

### Building for Production

```bash
npm run build
```

## Usage

### Adding Words

1. **Manual Entry**: Click "Add Word" in the List view
2. **CSV Import**: Click "Import CSV" and select your file
   - **New Format**: Choose source and target languages from detected columns
   - **Legacy Format**: Automatically imported with existing language settings
3. **Example CSV**: Click "Download Example" to get a sample CSV file with 50 common words in 4 languages
4. **Bulk Import**: Import large word lists from CSV files

#### Import Process

1. Click "Import CSV" button in the List view
2. Select your CSV file
3. The app will automatically detect the format:

4. For new format, select up to 4 languages to display in the table
5. All language combinations will be created automatically
6. Click "Import with Configuration" to complete

#### Multi-Language Support

The new format supports importing multiple languages and automatically creates all possible language pairs. For example, if you have a CSV with English, French, Chinese, and Japanese, and you select all 4 languages for display, the app will create:

- English ‚Üí French, Chinese, Japanese
- French ‚Üí English, Chinese, Japanese  
- Chinese ‚Üí English, French, Japanese
- Japanese ‚Üí English, French, Chinese

This gives you 12 different study combinations from a single CSV file!

### CSV Format

The application supports two CSV formats:

#### New Format (Recommended)
Use language-specific columns for maximum flexibility:

```csv
id,word_en,word_fr,word_zh,word_ja,times,learned,errors,last_review,spell_errors,notes,stars
1,hello,bonjour,‰Ω†Â•Ω,„Åì„Çì„Å´„Å°„ÅØ,0,0,0,,0,,
2,thank you,merci,Ë∞¢Ë∞¢,„ÅÇ„Çä„Åå„Å®„ÅÜ,0,0,0,,0,,
```

**Columns:**
- `id`: Unique identifier (auto-generated if not provided)
- `word_{language}`: Text in specific language (e.g., `word_en`, `word_fr`, `word_zh`)
- `times`: Number of correct attempts
- `learned`: Number of successful learning attempts
- `errors`: Number of incorrect attempts
- `last_review`: Last review date (ISO string)
- `spell_errors`: Number of spelling errors
- `notes`: Optional notes
- `stars`: Star rating from 0-5 (0 means no stars)

**Language Configuration:**
When importing, you'll be prompted to select which language is the source and which is the target.

#### Legacy Format (Supported)
Traditional format with explicit language columns:

```csv
id,lang_src,lang_tgt,text_src,text_tgt,times,errors,last_review,spell_errors,notes
1,en-US,fr-FR,hello,bonjour,0,0,,0,
2,en-US,fr-FR,thank you,merci,0,0,,0,
```

**Columns:**

- `lang_tgt`: Target language (BCP-47 format)
- `text_src`: Source text
- `text_tgt`: Target text
- `times`: Number of correct attempts
- `errors`: Number of incorrect attempts
- `last_review`: Last review date (ISO string)
- `spell_errors`: Number of spelling errors

### ‚≠ê Star Rating System

The app includes a comprehensive star rating system for organizing and prioritizing your vocabulary:

#### **Star Button Features**
- **Click to Cycle**: Click the star button to cycle through ratings (0 ‚Üí 1 ‚Üí 2 ‚Üí 3 ‚Üí 4 ‚Üí 5 ‚Üí 0)
- **Visual Feedback**: Color-coded stars for easy recognition:
  - **0 stars**: No fill (light grey outline)
  - **1 star**: Light blue
  - **2 stars**: Green
  - **3 stars**: Yellow
  - **4 stars**: Orange
  - **5 stars**: Red

#### **Sorting by Stars**
- **Stars (Highest First)**: Shows 5-star words first, then 4-star, etc.
- **Stars (Lowest First)**: Shows 0-star words first, then 1-star, etc.
- **Default Position**: Star sorting options appear first in the sort dropdown

#### **CSV Integration**
- **Import**: Stars column is automatically imported from CSV files
- **Export**: Stars are included in CSV exports for data portability
- **Default Value**: New words start with 0 stars

### Learning Priority Algorithm

Words are prioritized for study based on:

1. **Unlearned words** (times === 0) have highest priority
2. **Error count** (descending - most errors first)
3. **Last review date** (ascending - oldest first)

### Text-to-Speech Setup

#### Web Speech API
- Works out of the box in modern browsers
- No API key required
- Voice selection available in settings

### Data Management

#### Clearing All Data
To start with a fresh, empty word list:

1. **Via UI**: Go to Settings ‚Üí Click "Clear All Data" button
2. **Via Browser**: Press F12 ‚Üí Application tab ‚Üí IndexedDB ‚Üí Delete "polyglot_words" key
3. **For Development**: Set `VITE_CLEAR_DATA_ON_STARTUP=true` in `.env` file

#### Data Persistence
- All data is stored locally in your browser using IndexedDB
- Data persists between browser sessions and app restarts
- Data is not synced to any external servers (fully offline)
